    BeautyQuestion: "What is your daily skincare routine?",
    BeautyAnswer:
      "My daily skincare routine is pretty straightforward—I keep it simple with just sunscreen and plenty of water. I find that a good sunscreen is essential for protecting my skin from the sun’s harmful rays, and staying hydrated by drinking a lot of water keeps my skin looking fresh. While I haven’t yet delved into a more detailed skincare regimen, I might explore one in the future. For now, these basics keep me feeling confident and ready to take on the day.",

    BeautyQuestion:
      "How do you maintain your hair's health with all the styling and shoots?",
    BeautyAnswer:
      "Maintaining the health of my curly hair amidst all the styling and shoots is all about careful management. Since my hair is naturally smooth and curly, I focus on minimizing heat exposure and avoid using chemicals or dyes that could damage its texture. I prioritize gentle styling practices and use heat-free methods whenever possible to preserve its natural health and shine. By taking these precautions, I ensure my hair remains in top condition, even with the demands of frequent styling and photoshoots.",
