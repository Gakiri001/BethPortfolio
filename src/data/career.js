      "I got my start in the modeling industry quite unexpectedly. In February 2019, a friend of mine sent me a poster for a high-fashion event hosted by Cuffest Modeling Agency. Intrigued, I decided to attend the audition, even though I had no prior runway experience. To my surprise, they chose me to join their roster.

      " What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as a model?",
    CareerAnswer:
      "One of the biggest challenges I've faced as a model is the financial strain associated with the profession. Financing a modeling career is no small feat—photo shoots can be expensive, and the costs don't stop there. Designers, stylists, makeup artists, and hair artists all need to be compensated, and maintaining a wardrobe that aligns with industry standards requires significant investment. It can be tough to find platforms that truly value modeling as both a skill and a viable source of income. Navigating these financial hurdles has been a constant balancing act, but it's also fueled my determination to succeed in this competitive field."
