    BTSQuestion: "What’s it like behind the scenes of a fashion shoot?",
    BTSAnswer:
      "Behind the scenes of a fashion shoot for me is all about ease and fun, especially since I usually work with people who are close to me or friends. I fully trust my team, appreciating every idea they bring to the table. I don’t make all the decisions myself—in fact, I let them handle everything from the color of my nail art to the makeup. I trust their expertise completely, knowing they’ll choose what looks best. These moments are always something I look forward to, as the collaboration results in something truly magical.",

    BTSQuestion: "How do you prepare for a big shoot or runway show?",
    BTSAnswer:
      "I begin by involving God in everything, starting my day with a prayer for success and a beautiful experience. I then pack my essentials, make an early call to my team to ensure everything is set, and fuel myself with a healthy meal. I also take a moment to say affirmations like, “I can do it” and “I am confident,” and declare that it will be the best day of my life. This routine helps me approach the day with positivity and assurance.",
